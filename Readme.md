# gometer

Read and count meter values from ferraris current meters and gas meters

## Configration

My meter configuration is hard coded in the project: 

* Ferraris electricity meter for the electricity consumed (75 rotations per kWh on GPIO 27 on raspberry pi zero w)
* Ferraris electricity meter for the electricity generated by our photovolatic system (375 rotations per kWh on GPIO 17  on raspberry pi zero w)
* gas meter with magnet pulse every 0.001 m³ (I²C bus using qmc5883l)

## Components

* Raspberry pi zero w
* TCRT5000 to detect the rotation on the ferraris meters
* QMC5883l magnet detector (GY-271) to detect the magnetic pulse on the gas meter

## Project

It's my first golang project so the code may be ugly

* lib module for handling the QMC5883l
* a little http server to set/fix the current values
